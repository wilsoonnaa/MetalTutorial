# Metal Tutorial
Welcome to the repository for the [metaltutorial.com](https://www.metaltutorial.com) site. This tutorial will teach you the basics of Apple's Metal Graphics and Compute API, and help you understand how to program with it in C++ via the metal-cpp library that Apple has now officially released. There isn't much documentation for it yet, and it is missing some features, so I'll show you how to work around those in the following chapters. This will not necessarily serve as a guide or introduction to Computer Graphics, but more as a way to get up and running with Metal using C++. For those who are completely new, I'll try to go over everything in as much detail as I possibly can, and link to other existing guides for more information as necessary. I hope that this can be of use to you. If you'd like to contribute your own content to this tutorial series, or correct any mistakes that I've made, feel free to send me a message.

Head on over to the website to get started. :)
