Otherwise, read on!</p> <p>Metal is designed to be written in a programming language called Objective-C. Objective-C, along with Apple's Swift programming language, are the languages typically used to write macOS and iOS applications. In this tutorial series, however, we're going to be writing our application primarily in C++, as this is the industry standard for writing Computer Graphics related applications, whether it be for real-time rendering in video games, or for CAD software. I say \"primarily\" because we'll actually be using a bit of \"Objective-C++\", which allows us to mix Objective-C code with C++ to make things a little easier for us. Even though Metal is typically written in pure Objective-C, for convenience Apple has released a set of C++ bindings that act as an interface to the the Metal Graphics API, allowing us to write high-performance graphics and compute applications for Apple devices in (almost) pure C++. This wrapper is very light-weight, and acts as a one-to-one translation between the native Objective-C functions calls and C++. You're going to need to download the library here.</p> <p>Once you have downloaded the <code>metal-cpp</code> library, open Xcode and <code>Create a new Xcode project</code>. For this tutorial we're going to be targetting Mac devices, so under the <code>macOS</code> templates, select <code>Command Line Tool</code>. This will set the default language to C++ and give us an empty <code>Hello-World</code> project.</p> <p>The first thing we want to do is drag and drop our freshly downloaded and unzipped 'metal-cpp' folder into our Xcode project.</p> <p></p> <p>Now that we've got it copied over to our project, we need to make sure Xcode can find it.

Apple's <code>metal-cpp</code> guide tells us that we need to define the <code>metal-cpp</code> implementation in only one of our <code>.cpp</code> files.

This is where a cross platform windowing library called <code>GLFW</code> comes in. Typically, it's used in conjunction with the OpenGL graphics API, but we can disable this functionality to be able to use it with Metal. In short, it's going to make window creation, as well as keyboard/mouse/controller input handling really easy for us. MacOS has it's own windowing library that's part of the Cocoa framework, but I'm not familiar with how to use it, and we'll able to setup GLFW and get it to expose the part of Cocoa windowing that we will need in about 5 lines of code.</p> <p>There's a couple of different ways to get GLFW. One way is to download the macOS pre-compiled binaries on the glfw website. This is the way I've set it up on the GitHub repository, starting with Lesson 0. You can head over there and clone that project if you'd like to use GLFW's pre-compiled universal binaries, supported on Intel as well as M1 and later Macs.</p> <p>Alternatively, you can get it via the <code>brew</code> package manager, which is what I'll show here. If you don't have <code>brew</code>, you can get it here: brew.sh. It's a very useful tool to have for software development on Mac. It's essentially like <code>apt-get</code> on Debian Linux distros, if you're familiar with that.</p> <p>Once you have brew, you can install glfw with this terminal command: <pre><code>brew install glfw\n</code></pre> Now, we need to add brew's header <code>include</code> directory to our Xcode header search path, so Xcode can find GLFW's header files. </p> <p>If you're not sure what kind of Mac you have, click the \uf8ff logo in the top left of your screen, hit <code>About This Mac</code> and check the Chip type.</p> <p>If you're on an M1 Mac, like I am, you can add this directory under the <code>Build Settings</code> section for your Xcode target: <pre><code>/opt/homebrew/Cellar/glfw/...version_goes_here.../include\n</code></pre> </p> <p>Alternatively, if you have an Intel Mac, brew will install packages to the <code>/usr/local</code> directory. Correspondingly, you can use this directory instead: <pre><code>/usr/local/Cellar/glfw/...version_goes_here.../include\n</code></pre></p> <p>Next, we're going to link with the glfw dynamic library.

We're going to stash all of our rendering engine logic in a new file we'll call <code>mtl_engine.mm</code>, with the corresponding header <code>mtl_engine.hpp</code>. You might be wondering what the <code>.mm</code> extension is for. This is where the Objective-C I discussed in the <code>Setup</code> section comes in. Essentially, it tells Xcode to allow us to combine C++ and Objective-C code in the same file and compile it. We have to do this, because some of the windowing functions we'll need aren't mapped to the <code>metal-cpp</code> library for some reason, at least at the time of writing this. Critically, we're going to want to change our <code>main.cpp</code> file to <code>main.mm</code> as well.</p> <p>In <code>mtl_engine.hpp</code>, we're first going to include the necessary headers for <code>GLFW</code> and <code>metal-cpp</code>: mtl_engine.hpp<pre><code>#pragma once\n#define GLFW_INCLUDE_NONE\n#import &lt;GLFW/glfw3.h&gt;\n#define GLFW_EXPOSE_NATIVE_COCOA\n#import &lt;GLFW/glfw3native.h&gt;\n#include &lt;Metal/Metal.hpp&gt;\n#include &lt;Metal/Metal.h&gt;\n#include &lt;QuartzCore/CAMetalLayer.hpp&gt;\n#include &lt;QuartzCore/CAMetalLayer.h&gt;\n#include &lt;QuartzCore/QuartzCore.hpp&gt;\n</code></pre> Notice the <code>#define GLFW_EXPOSE_NATIVE_COCOA</code> bit, which is a macro that exposes the native APIs of GLFW for the Cocoa framework on MacOS. It's critical to include that, as it's responsible for our windowing technique!</p> <p>Next, we'll define our Metal Engine class, <code>MTLEngine</code>: mtl_engine.hpp<pre><code>class MTLEngine {\npublic:\nvoid init();\nvoid run();\nvoid cleanup();\nprivate:\nvoid initDevice();\nvoid initWindow();\nMTL::Device* metalDevice;\nGLFWwindow* glfwWindow;\nNSWindow* metalWindow;\nCAMetalLayer* metalLayer;\n};\n</code></pre> We have three public functions that will be driven in our applications <code>main</code> function, <code>init()</code>, <code>run()</code>, and <code>cleanup()</code>. The <code>init()</code> function will do all of our Window and Metal setup. We're keeping it simple for now, just enough functionality to get a window opened. You'll notice 4 member variables defined at the bottom. The <code>MTL::Device* metalDevice</code> gives us access to our devices GPU, and the plethora of commands that it provides us for rendering and GPU compute work. <code>GLFWwindow* glfwWindow</code> gives us a handle to our GLFWwindow, as well as GLFW's various callback functions, like handling keyboard input and whatnot. For those who are unfamiliar, you can read more on GLFW's functionality at glfw.com. We also have our <code>NSWindow* metalWindow</code> and <code>CAMetalLayer* metalLayer</code>, which are actually our first two Objective-C variables. I'll explain their purpose when we create the window.</p> <p>First, let's take a look at the Engine implementation: mtl_engine.mm<pre><code>#include \"mtl_engine.hpp\"\nvoid MTLEngine::init() {\ninitDevice();\ninitWindow();\n}\nvoid MTLEngine::run() {\nwhile (!glfwWindowShouldClose(glfwWindow)) {\nglfwPollEvents();\n}\n}\nvoid MTLEngine::cleanup() {\nglfwTerminate();\nmetalDevice-&gt;release();\n}\nvoid MTLEngine::initDevice() {\nmetalDevice = MTL::CreateSystemDefaultDevice();\n}\nvoid MTLEngine::initWindow() {\nglfwInit();\nglfwWindowHint(GLFW_CLIENT_API, GLFW_NO_API);\nglfwWindow = glfwCreateWindow(800, 600, \"Metal Engine\", NULL, NULL);\nif (!glfwWindow) {\nglfwTerminate();\nexit(EXIT_FAILURE);\n}\nmetalWindow = glfwGetCocoaWindow(glfwWindow);\nmetalLayer = [CAMetalLayer layer];\nmetalLayer.device = (__bridge id&lt;MTLDevice&gt;)metalDevice;\nmetalLayer.pixelFormat = MTLPixelFormatBGRA8Unorm;\nmetalWindow.contentView.layer = metalLayer;\nmetalWindow.contentView.wantsLayer = YES;\n}\n</code></pre> It's only 38 lines, so it shouldn't be terribly confusing.</p> <p>mtl_engine.mm<pre><code>void MTLEngine::init() {\ninitDevice();\ninitWindow();\n}\n</code></pre> In the <code>init()</code> function, all we're going to be doing is calling our Metal Device and GLFW Window setup methods: <code>initDevice()</code> and <code>initWindow()</code>.</p> <p>mtl_engine.mm<pre><code>void MTLEngine::initDevice() {\nmetalDevice = MTL::CreateSystemDefaultDevice();\n}\n</code></pre> The contents of <code>initDevice()</code> should look familiar, we're simply using the <code>metal-cpp</code> library to create our Metal Device handle which gives us access to our GPU. We'll use our Metal Device for many things, but not limited to: </p> <ul> <li>Shader Library creation.</li> <li>Buffer and Texture Resource creation, and passing data betwen the CPU and GPU.</li> <li>Render and Compute Pipeline creation.</li> </ul> <p>We'll get into the details of what all these things mean in the following chapters as they come up.</p> <p>mtl_engine.mm<pre><code>void MTLEngine::initWindow() {\nglfwInit();\nglfwWindowHint(GLFW_CLIENT_API, GLFW_NO_API);\nglfwWindow = glfwCreateWindow(800, 600, \"Metal Engine\", NULL, NULL);\nif (!glfwWindow) {\nglfwTerminate();\nexit(EXIT_FAILURE);\n}\nmetalWindow = glfwGetCocoaWindow(glfwWindow);\nmetalLayer = [CAMetalLayer layer];\nmetalLayer.device = (__bridge id&lt;MTLDevice&gt;)metalDevice;\nmetalLayer.pixelFormat = MTLPixelFormatBGRA8Unorm;\nmetalWindow.contentView.layer = metalLayer;\nmetalWindow.contentView.wantsLayer = YES;\n}\n</code></pre> The <code>initWindow()</code> function first initializes GLFW, and uses <code>glfwWindowHint()</code> to tell GLFW not to create the OpenGL graphics context, as we're using Metal instead :). We set our <code>glfwWindow</code>, with a window width of <code>800</code> and height of <code>600</code>, and a window name of <code>Metal Engine</code>. If window creation fails, we exit.</p> <p>We then set our <code>metalWindow</code> with a call to <code>glfwGetCocoaWindow()</code>, specifying our <code>glfwWindow</code> as the input. This gives us a reference to the underlying native macOS Cocoa window that <code>GLFW</code> uses underneath for window management. We then use some funky Objective-C syntax <code>[CAMetalLayer layer]</code> to create a metalLayer, as the <code>metal-cpp</code> library does not yet expose all of the parts necessary to do this for some reason. We then set a device, using the <code>__bridge id&lt;MTLDevice&gt;</code> cast to convert from a C++ <code>MTL::Device*</code> pointer to an Objective-C <code>MTLDevice*</code>. We'll eventually end up using this bridging interface a little bit more to convert back and forth between Objective-C and C++ types. We then set the <code>pixelFormat</code> for the <code>metalLayer</code>, and give the <code>metalLayer</code> to the Cocoa window. </p> <p>By setting the layer of the <code>contentView</code> to our <code>metalLayer</code>, we're telling the Cocoa window underneath to use the Metal layer for rendering its content. The Metal layer will provide the low-level access to Metal that we need to perform our graphics rendering. Once the layer of the <code>contentView</code> is set, any content that we draw on the Metal layer will be displayed in the window. Essentially, the Metal layer is acting as what's called the \"framebuffer\". We also specify the <code>wantsLayer</code> property of the window's <code>contentView</code>, to ensure that the Cocoa window underneath will use the <code>metalLayer</code> for rendering its content.</p> <p>mtl_engine.mm<pre><code>void MTLEngine::run() {\nwhile (!glfwWindowShouldClose(glfwWindow)) {\nglfwPollEvents();\n}\n}\n</code></pre> Next, we have the <code>run()</code> function, which will eventually be our main program loop, where we'll handle our window updates and draw to the screen. The loop continues until <code>glfwWindowShouldClose(glfwWindow)</code> returns true, which for now will only happen when you hit the red close button at the top of the window. Every iteration of the loop, we'll need to call <code>glfwPollEvents()</code>, which we'll eventually use for handling keyboard input. If you don't include it now, the window won't launch!</p> <p>mtl_engine.mm<pre><code>void MTLEngine::cleanup() {\nglfwTerminate();\n}\n</code></pre> Our last function is the <code>cleanup()</code> function, where we'll eventually be handling our de-initiallisation and de-allocation of resources upon program close. For now, this will just include these two commands, <code>glfwTerminate()</code>, and <code>metalDevice-&gt;release()</code>. What is <code>release()</code> for?

This means that you're responsible for de-allocation of the resource after you're done with it. Whenever an object is created using one of these aforementioned functions, it is assigned by default a <code>retainCount</code> of 1. When an objects <code>retainCount</code> becomes 0, the object is deallocated.

Exciting stuff. We're going to start with something simple: a triangle!</p>"},{"location":"Lesson%201%3A%20Hello%20Metal/2.%20Hello%20Triangle/#the-graphics-rendering-pipeline","title":"The Graphics Rendering Pipeline","text":"<p>Before we can render our triangle, it has to pass through something called the \"Graphics Pipeline\". The Graphics Pipeline is the series of steps that we must go through to render objects to our screen:</p> <p></p> <p>The steps listed in green are fully programmable by you. We write the code for the C++ application as well as the Vertex and Fragment Shader programs that are executed on the GPU. GPUs are massively parallel devices, and Shader programs are specifically designed to take advantage of this fact. Unlike with CPUs where you might have 4, 8, 16, or maybe even 32 individual cores, GPUs have hundrends and thousands of them, all running in parallel. Vertex shaders are designed to operate on the vertices of the meshes in our scene concurrently. Initially, our Vertex Shader will transform all 3 vertices of our triangle mesh at once, and this process will scale continously as we render more complicated scenes with more complicated meshes. A similar logic applies with the Fragment Shader. The Fragment Shader (sometimes called the \"Pixel\" Shader) operates on each pixel that we'll want to render, as determined by the output of the Rasterization stage. Modern displays have many individual pixels on them, which makes them a perfect candidate for GPU processing. The steps highlighted above in red are not programmable stages, but are instead configurable. We'll modify them as necessary in the following lessons. Here is a more detailed description of the steps involved in the Graphics Pipeline:</p> <ol> <li>The Application Stage: In our case, the \"Application Stage\" involves setting up our <code>MTLEngine</code>, intializing the Metal device, configuring a GLFW window, compiling shader code into a library, creating command buffers, encoding draw commands, managing the render loop, and more. This stage represents the C++ side of the process, preparing the environment for encoding GPU commands for rendering or compute related tasks.</li> <li>The Vertex Shader Stage: This is the stage in the pipeline where the GPU comes into play. In other Graphics APIs such as DirectX, typically the second stage of the Graphics Pipeline starts with something called the \"Input Assembler\", which is responsible for collecting and organizing vertex data from memory buffers on the GPU and feeding them into the rendering pipeline. In Metal, this functionality is integrated with the Vertex Shader stage. The Vertex Shader is responsible for processing vertex data, applying transformations, and passing the resulting data to the next stages of the rendering pipeline. To feed vertex data into the Vertex Shader in Metal, you define vertex descriptors that specify the layout and format of the vertex data. These descriptors are used to map vertex data from the vertex buffers to the input attributes of the Vertex Shader. This process effectively replaces the Input Assembler stage found in other Graphics APIs, streamlining the rendering pipeline in Metal.</li> <li>The Rasterization Stage: In Metal, the Rasterization Stage converts vector-based geometry (aka vertices) into pixel-based fragments. It processes transformed vertices from the Vertex Shader, assembles them into primitives, interpolates attributes, performs perspective division, clips vertices to the view frustum, and identifies the pixels we want to shade within the rendered geometry. This stage effectively prepares the pixels or \"fragments\" for further processing and shading in the Fragment Shader Stage.</li> <li>The Fragment Shader Stage: The Fragment Shader in Metal is responsible for processing and shading pixel-based fragments generated during rasterization. The Fragment Shader is executed for each pixel on the screen, and typically performs a series of mathematical operations to calculate the final color of the pixel, such as texture sampling, lighting and material property calculations, blending with the color of nearby pixels, etc. Once processed, the fragments are combined to create the final rendered image on the screen.</li> <li>The Blending Stage: The Blending stage in Metal is responsible for combining the output of the Fragment Shader stage with the existing data in the framebuffer, considering factors like transparency, translucency, and depth. It determines how the final color of each pixel is calculated by blending the incoming fragment color with the color already present in the framebuffer, ultimately producing the final rendered image on the screen.</li> </ol> <p>Additionally, we also have another type of shader called \"Compute Shaders\". A Compute Shader is a program that runs on the GPU, seperate from the traditional rendering pipeline. It is used to perform general-purpose computational tasks that are generally (but not always) unrelated to rendering, such as image and audio processing, phsysics simulation, and machine learning. Compute shaders provide for an incredibly high degree of parallelism, and allow a user to perform parallel operations and algorithms much faster than on the CPU. We'll get into more detail about how we can use these in the Advanced Chapters later on.</p> <p>Now that I've described the Graphics Pipeline and these things called Shaders, let's get to writing some.</p> <p>To render our triangle, we'll need to create a new shader file in our Xcode project called <code>triangle.metal</code>. Unlike other Graphics APIs, in Metal there is only one file extension for writing shaders. You use the function definition to define a function as a vertex, fragment, or compute function. In our new Shader file, we're going to write two shader functions, correspondingly titled <code>vertexShader()</code> and <code>fragmentShader()</code>: triangle.metal<pre><code>#include &lt;metal_stdlib&gt;\nusing namespace metal;\nvertex float4\nvertexShader(uint vertexID [[vertex_id]],\nconstant simd::float3* vertexPositions)\n{\nfloat4 vertexOutPositions = float4(vertexPositions[vertexID][0],\nvertexPositions[vertexID][1],\nvertexPositions[vertexID][2],\n1.0f);\nreturn vertexOutPositions;\n}\nfragment float4 fragmentShader(float4 vertexOutPositions [[stage_in]]) {\nreturn float4(182.0f/255.0f, 240.0f/255.0f, 228.0f/255.0f, 1.0f);\n}\n</code></pre> The Metal shading language is essentially builty on top of C++14, and has some restrictions. You can learn more about the restrictions in section 1.4.4 of the Metal Specification. We first include the Metal standard library, and add a <code>using namespace metal;</code>. We need to pre-pend our <code>vertexShader()</code> function definition with the <code>vertex</code> keyword to tell Metal that this is a vertex function. We'll be returning a float4, made up of the position of each vertex in the triangle. Shader programs run concurrently on the GPU, so each vertex we input will be processed simultaneously. To render our triangle, since we have three input vertices, we'll really have three instances of this <code>vertexShader()</code> function running at the same time. This is why the first take in the vertexID as input, so that we can know which vertex we're working on. The second input is our triangle's <code>vertexPositions</code> buffer. You'll notice the <code>constant</code> keyword prepended to our type definition. This is called an address space attribute, and it dictates the region of memory that the buffer is located in on the GPU. Quoting the Metal Specification directly, \"the <code>constant</code> address space name refers to buffer memory objects allocated from the device memory pool that are read-only\". Essentially, the buffer is allocated on the GPU in read-only memory, we aren't going to be able to change it. You can read more about address spaces in section 4.0 of the Metal Specification. We'll use our <code>vertexID</code> to index the proper Vertex per Shader, and we're going to cast our <code>vertexPositions</code> to a larger homogeneous vector type of <code>float4</code>, as Vertex functions are required to output positions in four-dimensional clip-space coordinates. Here's a great write-up on why that's necessary over at learnopengl.com. </p> <p>Similarly, our <code>fragmentShader()</code> will output a <code>float4</code> of color values at each triangle Vertex, and interpolate between them. Since we're just returning the same color at each Vertex, the whole triangle will be the same color, as there aren't any other colors to interpolate between. You can fill these with any value's between 0.0-1.0, Red, Green, Blue. The input <code>vertexPositions</code> to the <code>fragmentShader()</code> isn't necessary quite yet, but it's there as a demonstration on how you would pass the vertexPositions for use within the Fragment shader. We'll make use of it once we have a triangle rendering.</p> <p>mtl_engine.hpp<pre><code>#include &lt;simd/simd.h&gt;\nclass MTLEngine {\npublic:\nvoid init();\nvoid run();\nvoid cleanup();\nprivate:\nvoid initDevice();\nvoid initWindow();\nvoid createTriangle();\nvoid createDefaultLibrary();\nvoid createCommandQueue();\nvoid createRenderPipeline();\nvoid encodeRenderCommand(MTL::RenderCommandEncoder* renderEncoder);\nvoid sendRenderCommand();\nvoid draw();\nMTL::Device* metalDevice;\nGLFWwindow* glfwWindow;\nNSWindow* metalWindow;\nCAMetalLayer* metalLayer;\nCA::MetalDrawable* metalDrawable;\nMTL::Library* metalDefaultLibrary;\nMTL::CommandQueue* metalCommandQueue;\nMTL::CommandBuffer* metalCommandBuffer;\nMTL::RenderPipelineState* metalRenderPSO;\nMTL::Buffer* triangleVertexBuffer;\n};\n</code></pre> Here are the headers, member functions and variables that we'll be adding to our MTLEngine. It may seem like quite a lot of stuff is required to render a simple triangle, and in the grand scheme of things it is. But, I assure you, the effort required in Metal is far less than the other modern Graphics APIs, being DirectX12 and Vulkan. In Vulkan, it typically takes about 1000 lines of code to render a single triangle \ud83d\ude31. With Metal, it will only take us about 100 lines of code to get there, and we've already got 40 of them :). Get your boots strapped ladies and gentleman, it's time to dive in.</p> <p>The first addition is <code>createTriangle()</code>: mtl_engine.mm<pre><code>void MTLEngine::init() {\ninitDevice();\ninitWindow();\ncreateTriangle();\n}\n...\n</code></pre> <pre><code>...\nvoid MTLEngine::createTriangle() {\nsimd::float3 triangleVertices[] = {\n{-0.5f, -0.5f, 0.0f},\n{ 0.5f, -0.5f, 0.0f},\n{ 0.0f,  0.5f, 0.0f}\n};\ntriangleVertexBuffer = metalDevice-&gt;newBuffer(&amp;triangleVertices,\nsizeof(triangleVertices),\nMTL::ResourceStorageModeShared);\n}\n</code></pre> This goes into our <code>init()</code> function after we initialize our Metal device and GLFW window. Given that our goal is to render a triangle, we first define some triangle vertices with our <code>simd::float3</code> vector type included from Apple's <code>&lt;simd/simd.h&gt;</code> library. The <code>simd</code> library is kind of Apple's equivalent to the <code>glm</code> library if you've worked with Vulkan or OpenGL. In fact, you can use glm, however there are some important differences to take into account. We'll use the <code>simd</code> library throughout this tutorial series to make it easier on ourselves. </p> <p>We then ask our Metal device to create a new Metal Buffer, copying our triangle vertices over to the GPU. You can think of a MTL::Buffer object like a buffer of data in any programming language, it's simply used to store data. Metal doesn't know anything about the contents or layout of the data - you can customize it however you like. All it knows is the size of the buffer, as it's the second argument you pass in to <code>newBuffer()</code>. You might notice the third argument, <code>MTL::ResourceStorageModeShared</code>. This tells Metal to give both the CPU and GPU the ability to access the object. We'll discuss the other two types of storage modes later on.</p> <p>The next addition to our MTLEngine is <code>createDefaultLibrary()</code>: mtl_engine.mm<pre><code>void MTLEngine::init() {\ninitDevice();\ninitWindow();\ncreateTriangle();\ncreateDefaultLibrary();\n}\n...\n</code></pre> <pre><code>...\nvoid MTLEngine::createDefaultLibrary() {\nmetalDefaultLibrary = metalDevice-&gt;newDefaultLibrary();\nif(!metalDefaultLibrary){\nstd::cerr &lt;&lt; \"Failed to load default library.\";\nstd::exit(-1);\n}\n}\n</code></pre> This goes into our <code>init()</code> function after we create our triangle and copy it to the GPU. The first thing we're going to do is access our <code>metalDevice</code> to create a new default library. Xcode automatically compiles all Metal source files (ending in <code>.metal</code>) within an Xcode project into a single default library upon project compilation. In our case, because we're not compiling our Metal source code at runtime, our <code>MTL::Library*</code> object will give us access to all of our Metal source code from a single source, making it very simple to access and manage. If for any reason we're unable to load our compiled Metal binaries, we'll exit. If for any reason later on you get any errors here, make sure that your Metal source files are added as compile targets in the <code>Build Phases</code> section of the project.</p> <p>mtl_engine.mm<pre><code>void MTLEngine::init() {\ninitDevice();\ninitWindow();\ncreateTriangle();\ncreateDefaultLibrary();\ncreateCommandQueue();\n}\n...\n</code></pre> <pre><code>...\nvoid MTLEngine::createCommandQueue() {\nmetalCommandQueue = metalDevice-&gt;newCommandQueue();\n}\n</code></pre> We'll now ask our Metal device to create a new Command Queue for us.

It specifies how the GPU processes vertex and fragment data to generate the final output image. Render pipelines are created and configured once, and then used repeatedly for rendering similar graphics objects. In this case, our render pipeline is setup to render individual triangles. It will contain the vertex and fragment functions that we defined earlier in our <code>triangle.metal</code> shader file. In Lesson two, we'll explore how we can create a second render pipeline to handle lights in our scene, using entirely seperate vertex and fragment shader functions from the ones our triangle uses.</p> <p>mtl_engine.mm<pre><code>void MTLEngine::init() {\ninitDevice();\ninitWindow();\ncreateTriangle();\ncreateDefaultLibrary();\ncreateCommandQueue();\ncreateRenderPipeline();\n}\n...\n</code></pre> <pre><code>...\nvoid MTLEngine::createRenderPipeline() {\nMTL::Function* vertexShader = metalDefaultLibrary-&gt;newFunction(NS::String::string(\"vertexShader\", NS::ASCIIStringEncoding));\nassert(vertexShader);\nMTL::Function* fragmentShader = metalDefaultLibrary-&gt;newFunction(NS::String::string(\"fragmentShader\", NS::ASCIIStringEncoding));\nassert(fragmentShader);\nMTL::RenderPipelineDescriptor* renderPipelineDescriptor = MTL::RenderPipelineDescriptor::alloc()-&gt;init();\nrenderPipelineDescriptor-&gt;setLabel(NS::String::string(\"Triangle Rendering Pipeline\", NS::ASCIIStringEncoding));\nrenderPipelineDescriptor-&gt;setVertexFunction(vertexShader);\nrenderPipelineDescriptor-&gt;setFragmentFunction(fragmentShader);\nassert(renderPipelineDescriptor);\nMTL::PixelFormat pixelFormat = (MTL::PixelFormat)metalLayer.pixelFormat;\nrenderPipelineDescriptor-&gt;colorAttachments()-&gt;object(0)-&gt;setPixelFormat(pixelFormat);\nNS::Error* error;\nmetalRenderPSO = metalDevice-&gt;newRenderPipelineState(renderPipelineDescriptor, &amp;error);\nrenderPipelineDescriptor-&gt;release();\n}\n</code></pre> We're first going to grab our two Metal functions from our <code>metalDefaultLibrary</code>, specifying the names of the corresponding Vertex and Fragment Shader functions. We then create a <code>MTL::RenderPipelineDescriptor</code> object, which allows us to to configure a variety of settings to use during a render pass. First we'll set the optional Label to give it a name, and then the Vertex and Fragment functions. We then set a Pixel format for our output image, which should match the format of our render target (aka our metalLayer). The color attachment in the <code>renderPipelineDescriptor</code> is used to specify the format and layout of the color buffer that will be used to store the output of our Fragment Shader. This buffer is where the final color information for each pixel of the rendered image is stored. We then use our <code>metalDevice</code> to represent a compiled Render Pipeline. We'll create a new <code>MTL::RenderPipelineState</code> object, specifying our <code>renderPipelineDescriptor</code> as input. In Metal, a render pipeline is a series of stages that process vertex and fragment data and produce a final image. Once we've created this pipeline state object, we can use it to render objects by encoding render commands into a Command Buffer and submitting it the GPU for drawing. You only have to create this object once, rather than each time we render a new frame. You can create a <code>MTL::RenderPipelineState</code> for each render pipeline that you may want. In our case, we'll just need this one. At the end of our function, we'll release our <code>renderPipelineDescriptor</code> object, as we're the owner of it (because we called <code>alloc()</code> to create it) and we won't be needing it anymore once the Render Pipeline has been created.</p> <p>With this, we've finished off our <code>init()</code> function.

The metal-cpp <code>README.md</code> describes the purpose of this better than I can, so i'll quote them here:</p> <p>AutoreleasePools and Objects</p> <p>Several methods that create temporary objects in *metal-cpp*** add them to an <code>AutoreleasePool</code> to help manage their lifetimes. In these situations, after *metal-cpp* creates the object, it adds it to an <code>AutoreleasePool</code>, which will release its objects when you release (or drain) it.</p> <p>By adding temporary objects to an AutoreleasePool, you do not need to explicitly call <code>release()</code> to deallocate them. Instead, you can rely on the <code>AutoreleasePool</code> to implicitly manage those lifetimes.</p> <p>If you create an object with a method that does not begin with <code>alloc</code>, <code>new</code>, <code>copy</code>, <code>mutableCopy</code>, or <code>Create</code>, the creating method adds the object to an autorelease pool.</p> <p>The typical scope of an <code>AutoreleasePool</code> is one frame of rendering for the main thread of the program. When the thread returns control to the RunLoop (an object responsible for receiving input and events from the windowing system), the pool is *drained*, releasing its objects.</p> <p>As such, our <code>AutoreleasePool</code> surrounds our <code>draw()</code> command, as they recommend. This will allow it to clean up some of the temporarily created objects for us each frame, like our <code>metalDrawable</code>, so we don't get any memory leaks.</p>"},{"location":"Lesson%201%3A%20Hello%20Metal/2.%20Hello%20Triangle/#drawing-render-passes-and-render-pipelines","title":"Drawing: Render Passes and Render Pipelines","text":"<p>In Metal, a render pass is a collection of rendering commands that takes a set of input resources (textures, buffers, etc.) and processes them through the graphics pipeline to produce an output, typically a rendered image. It groups related rendering operations performed on specific attachments (textures) to optimize the rendering process. To perform a render pass, you create a Command Encoder using the configured Render Pass Descriptor. The encoder is responsible for encoding draw commands, setting pipeline state, and providing resources (textures, buffers, etc.) to the graphics pipeline.

We first use our <code>metalCommandQueue</code> to create a Command Buffer. To encode render commands to a Command Buffer, we'll need a <code>MTL::RenderCommandEncoder</code>. Before we create one though, we'll need a <code>MTL::RenderPassDescriptor</code> , which serves to hold a collection of attachments for pixels generated by a render pass. The <code>colorAttachments</code> property specifies the textures or render targets that will be used to store the results of the render pass, hence why we give it the texture for our <code>metalDrawable</code>. We're going to also set a Clear Color, which is going to be the initial Color of all the pixels in the framebuffer. It'll essentially serve as the color of the background in our image. We then tell the GPU to store the rendered contents of our render pass to our <code>metalDrawable</code> texture with <code>MTL::StoreActionStore</code> when it's finished.</p> <p>We then create a <code>MTL::RenderCommandEncoder</code> to encode our render commands. Before we encode any commands, we need to tell the Command Encoder which Render Pipeline to process our commands in the context of. We set our Render Pipeline State to our previously created <code>metalRenderPSO</code> object, which defines our Triangle Rendering Pipeline. We then set our VertexBuffer to our <code>triangleVertexBuffer</code>, and tell it to draw the Triangle! With the Render Pipeline provided, the GPU will execute operations on the vetices of our triangle in the context of the vertex and fragment shader code we defined in our <code>triangle.metal</code> shader file. We then finish off our command encoding with <code>renderCommandEncoder-&gt;endEncoding()</code> to tell our Command Buffer that we're done issuing GPU commands. As a final command, we tell our Command Buffer to present the final Drawable, which will be the result of the command executed in the <code>renderCommandEncoder</code>. We then actually send these commands to the GPU with <code>metalCommandBuffer-&gt;commit()</code>. Critically, we tell the current thread to <code>waitUntilCompleted()</code>, which halts the execution of our C++ application until the GPU has finished its work. We'll discuss more complex methods of CPU&lt;-&gt;GPU synchronization later on.

The reason for this is due to a bug in GLFW. By default, our <code>metalLayer</code> resolution gets set to the resolution we specified in <code>glfwCreateWindow()</code>. Normally this wouldn't be an issue, but in MacOS the supposed window size doesn't necessarily correspond to the size of the image rendered within our window, aka our metalLayer or 'framebuffer'. This issue occurs due to DPI scaling within MacOS. On a high resolution monitor like a 4K monitor, or even on a Macbook Air Display, MacOS by default renders the UI at a \"lower resolution\" so that it appears larger on the screen. That's why if you ask GLFW what it's window size is, it will report 800x600, the values that we specified in <code>glfwCreateWindow()</code>, but if you ask what its framebuffer resolution is with <code>glfwGetFramebufferSize()</code>, it will likely be larger than that. It all depends on the scaling you have set in System Preferences. Anways, to counteract this issue, we'll need to make a few changes to our GLFWwindow and metalLayer creation:</p> <p>mtl_engine.cpp<pre><code>void MTLEngine::initWindow() {\nglfwInit();\nglfwWindowHint(GLFW_CLIENT_API, GLFW_NO_API);\nglfwWindow = glfwCreateWindow(800, 600, \"Metal Engine\", NULL, NULL);\nif (!glfwWindow) {\nglfwTerminate();\nexit(EXIT_FAILURE);\n}\nint width, height;\nglfwGetFramebufferSize(glfwWindow, &amp;width, &amp;height);\nmetalWindow = glfwGetCocoaWindow(glfwWindow);\nmetalLayer = [CAMetalLayer layer];\nmetalLayer.device = (__bridge id&lt;MTLDevice&gt;)metalDevice;\nmetalLayer.pixelFormat = MTLPixelFormatBGRA8Unorm;\nmetalLayer.drawableSize = CGSizeMake(width, height);\nmetalWindow.contentView.layer = metalLayer;\nmetalWindow.contentView.wantsLayer = YES;\n}\n</code></pre> With this, our <code>metalLayer</code> size should now be set to the internal frameBuffer resolution of the <code>glfwWindow</code> object, which will give us nice and sharp edges:</p> <p></p> <ol> <li> <p>This image references the creation of Command Buffers, as described in the Apple Metal Docs article titled Setting Up a Command Structure.\u00a0\u21a9</p> </li> </ol>"},{"location":"Lesson%201%3A%20Hello%20Metal/3.%20Textures/","title":"Basic Texturing with Metal","text":""},{"location":"Lesson%201%3A%20Hello%20Metal/3.%20Textures/#handling-window-resizing","title":"Handling Window Resizing","text":"<p>Before we jump into the fun of adding textures, there's one thing I'd like to add, and that is window resizing. Currently when we resize the window, the resolution of our <code>metalLayer.drawableSize</code> will not be updated. To handle this, we'll first define two new functions in our <code>MTLEngine</code> class:</p> <p>mtl_engine.hpp<pre><code>class MTLEngine {\n...\nstatic void frameBufferSizeCallback(GLFWwindow *window, int width, int height);\nvoid resizeFrameBuffer(int width, int height);\n...\n};\n</code></pre> And then we'll actually implement them: mtl_engine.cpp<pre><code>void MTLEngine::frameBufferSizeCallback(GLFWwindow *window, int width, int height) {\nMTLEngine* engine = (MTLEngine*)glfwGetWindowUserPointer(window);\nengine-&gt;resizeFrameBuffer(width, height);\n}\nvoid MTLEngine::resizeFrameBuffer(int width, int height) {\nmetalLayer.drawableSize = CGSizeMake(width, height);\n}\nvoid MTLEngine::initWindow() {\n...\nglfwSetWindowUserPointer(glfwWindow, this);\nglfwSetFramebufferSizeCallback(glfwWindow, frameBufferSizeCallback);\n...\n}\n</code></pre> GLFW gives us the ability to define a callback function for when the window is resized. It populates the <code>GLFWwindow*</code>, <code>width</code>, and <code>height</code> automatically for us. One issue is that if the callback function is created as a member function in a class, it's required to be static. Normally, this would be an issue, as we want to update the <code>drawableSize</code> property of our <code>metalLayer</code> variable, which is non-static. We can solve this problem by using the <code>glfwSetWindowUserPointer()</code> and <code>glfwGetWindowUserPointer()</code> functions provided by GLFW. We can store a pointer to our <code>MTLEngine</code> instance in the GLFW window, then retrieve it in the static callback function to access our non-static <code>resizeFramebuffer()</code> function, where we actually resize the <code>metalLayer.drawableSize</code>.</p> <p>Now when we resize our window, it will resize the <code>metalLayer</code> accordingly!</p>"},{"location":"Lesson%201%3A%20Hello%20Metal/3.%20Textures/#applying-textures-to-our-meshes","title":"Applying Textures to our Meshes","text":"<p>In order to apply a texture to our mesh, we're going to to need a texture image. You can choose any image you like, but I'll be going with this one. Feel free to use it as well. Once you have your image, create an assets folder in your Xcode project and place your image inside it. Now that we have a texture, we'll need a way to load it in to memory. For this we'll use <code>stbi_image</code>, which is a lightweight header-only image loading library. In the <code>external</code> directory, create a new folder called <code>stb</code>, and right click this link and save the header file there. Next, create an implementation file called <code>stbi_image.cpp</code> in the same folder and add this code: stbi_image.cpp<pre><code>#define STB_IMAGE_IMPLEMENTATION\n#include \"stb_image.h\"\n</code></pre> We now need to instruct Xcode to link with our <code>stbi_image.cpp</code> implementation. Go to your Project Settings -&gt; Build Phases -&gt; Compile Sources and add <code>stbi_image.cpp</code>.</p> <p>To load our texture, we'll create a new <code>Texture()</code> class.

We'll also define three public variables width, height, and channels to store the dimensions and number of color channels contained in our loaded image, as well as a handle to our Metal Device.

We then ask our device to create the texture for us with the specified parameters, and we then copy the image data into the texture buffer. Finally, we release the <code>textureDescriptor</code>, and free our <code>image</code> buffer. We now have a texture loaded into GPU memory! Hooray. Oh, and don't forget to create your destructor and release the <code>texture</code> on destruction.</p> <p>Now, we'll go back to our <code>mtl_engine.hpp</code> and make a few changes: mtl_engine.hpp<pre><code>...\n#include \"VertexData.hpp\"\n#include \"Texture.hpp\"\n#include &lt;stb/stb_image.h&gt;\n...\n#include &lt;filesystem&gt;\nclass MTLEngine {\npublic:\nvoid init();\nvoid run();\nvoid cleanup();\nprivate:\nvoid initDevice();\nvoid initWindow();\nvoid createSquare();\nvoid createDefaultLibrary();\nvoid createCommandQueue();\nvoid createRenderPipeline();\nvoid encodeRenderCommand(MTL::RenderCommandEncoder* renderEncoder);\nvoid sendRenderCommand();\nvoid draw();\nstatic void frameBufferSizeCallback(GLFWwindow *window, int width, int height);\nvoid resizeFrameBuffer(int width, int height);\nMTL::Device* metalDevice;\nGLFWwindow* glfwWindow;\nNSWindow* metalWindow;\nCAMetalLayer* metalLayer;\nCA::MetalDrawable* metalDrawable;\nMTL::Library* metalDefaultLibrary;\nMTL::CommandQueue* metalCommandQueue;\nMTL::CommandBuffer* metalCommandBuffer;\nMTL::RenderPipelineState* metalRenderPSO;\nMTL::Buffer* squareVertexBuffer;\nTexture* grassTexture;\n};\n</code></pre> The first thing to note is our new include files. You'll notice we haven't created <code>VertexData.hpp</code> yet, we'll get to that in a moment. We're no longer going to be rendering a triangle. Instead, we'll render a square, so change <code>createTriangle()</code> to <code>createSquare()</code>, and <code>triangleVertexBuffer</code> to <code>squareVertexBuffer</code>. Lastly, let's add our <code>grassTexture</code> member variable.</p> <p>As we're going to be rendering a texture, we're going to need to pass the GPU some extra information about how we'd like to map the texture to our square. We call this information \"uv\" or \"texture coordinates\". In this case, it will be very easy to create a mapping, as the four corners of our square will correspond directly to the four corners of our texture in uv coordinates. UV coordinates range from 0.0 to 1.0, with (0,0) corresponding to the bottom left-most corner of the texture image, and (1,1) corresponding to the top right-most corner. VertexData.hpp<pre><code>#pragma once\n#include &lt;simd/simd.h&gt;\nusing namespace simd;\nstruct VertexData {\nfloat4 position;\nfloat2 textureCoordinate;\n};\n</code></pre> Create a new file called <code>VertexData.hpp</code> and define a struct correspondingly named <code>VertexData</code>. You'll notice the inclusion of the <code>&lt;simd/simd.h&gt;</code> header file, which is an Apple library that contains math data-types that correspond directly with our Metal Shader datatypes, such as <code>float4</code> vectors, <code>float4x4</code> matrices, etc. We'll use this library to define our vertices as a <code>simd::float4</code>, and our texture coordinates as <code>simd::float2</code>. I've thrown in a <code>using namespace simd</code> for convenience.</p> <p>Now, we can hop back over to <code>mtl_engine.cpp</code> and define our square: mtl_engine.cpp<pre><code>void MTLEngine::createSquare() {\nVertexData squareVertices[] {\n{{-0.5, -0.5,  0.5, 1.0f}, {0.0f, 0.0f}},\n{{-0.5,  0.5,  0.5, 1.0f}, {0.0f, 1.0f}},\n{{ 0.5,  0.5,  0.5, 1.0f}, {1.0f, 1.0f}},\n{{-0.5, -0.5,  0.5, 1.0f}, {0.0f, 0.0f}},\n{{ 0.5,  0.5,  0.5, 1.0f}, {1.0f, 1.0f}},\n{{ 0.5, -0.5,  0.5, 1.0f}, {1.0f, 0.0f}}\n};\nsquareVertexBuffer = metalDevice-&gt;newBuffer(&amp;squareVertices, sizeof(squareVertices), MTL::ResourceStorageModeShared);\ngrassTexture = new Texture(\"assets/mc_grass.jpeg\", metalDevice);\n}\n</code></pre> You'll notice we're using six vertices in total to define the square, this is because our square is made up of two triangles, which share two vertices at the corners. Later, I'll cover indexed drawing, which will allow us to save precious memory resources by definining less vertices in total. For now though, this will do. We then of course want to create our <code>squareVertexBuffer</code>. Lastly, we'll create our <code>grassTexture</code> texture object. An important thing to note, is that if we want to specify a relative path to load the image like I've done here, we'll need to change our Xcode working directory to the project directory. We can do that by going to Product -&gt; Scheme -&gt; Edit Scheme, or by hitting <code>\u2318+&lt;</code>. Then go to Run -&gt; Options and click \"Use custom working directory:\" and specify <code>$(PROJECT_DIR)</code> as the directory. This should allow you to specify the correct path. Alternatively, you can specify the full-path to texture to load it if you like.</p> <p>mtl_engine.mm<pre><code>void MTLEngine::encodeRenderCommand(MTL::RenderCommandEncoder* renderCommandEncoder) {\nrenderCommandEncoder-&gt;setRenderPipelineState(metalRenderPSO);\nrenderCommandEncoder-&gt;setVertexBuffer(squareVertexBuffer, 0, 0);\nMTL::PrimitiveType typeTriangle = MTL::PrimitiveTypeTriangle;\nNS::UInteger vertexStart = 0;\nNS::UInteger vertexCount = 6;\nrenderCommandEncoder-&gt;setFragmentTexture(grassTexture-&gt;texture, 0);\nrenderCommandEncoder-&gt;drawPrimitives(typeTriangle, vertexStart, vertexCount);\n}\n</code></pre> Now we'll use our <code>renderCommandEncoder</code> to specify the buffer to load in our Vertex Shader for our square, and set the texture for use in our Fragment Shader.</p> <p>Finally, let's modify our Shader Code to be able to handle our Vertex Data and sample our texture. square.metal<pre><code>#include &lt;metal_stdlib&gt;\nusing namespace metal;\n#include \"VertexData.hpp\"\nstruct VertexOut {\n// The [[position]] attribute of this member indicates that this value\n// is the clip space position of the vertex when this structure is\n// returned from the vertex function.\nfloat4 position [[position]];\n// Since this member does not have a special attribute, the rasterizer\n// interpolates its value with the values of the other triangle vertices\n// and then passes the interpolated value to the fragment shader for each\n// fragment in the triangle.\nfloat2 textureCoordinate;\n};\nvertex VertexOut vertexShader(uint vertexID [[vertex_id]],\nconstant VertexData* vertexData) {\nVertexOut out;\nout.position = vertexData[vertexID].position;\nout.textureCoordinate = vertexData[vertexID].textureCoordinate;\nreturn out;\n}\nfragment float4 fragmentShader(VertexOut in [[stage_in]],\ntexture2d&lt;float&gt; colorTexture [[texture(0)]]) {\nconstexpr sampler textureSampler (mag_filter::linear,\nmin_filter::linear);\n// Sample the texture to obtain a color\nconst float4 colorSample = colorTexture.sample(textureSampler, in.textureCoordinate);\nreturn colorSample;\n}\n</code></pre> I mentioned in the previous chapter that the Metal Shading Language (MSL) is essentially C++14 with some limitations. This means we can include our new <code>VertexData</code> struct in our Shader code as well by including <code>VertexData.hpp</code>. </p> <p>As for our Vertex and Fragment shader functions, we'll need to rewrite them. I've defined a new struct <code>VertexOut</code>, which will hold our output data from the Vertex Shader. We need to declare the <code>[[position]]</code> attribute on our <code>position</code> member to indicate to Metal that it should apply perspective-division to it. Typically, our vertex-coordinate would be in clip-space by the end of our vertex function, but we have not yet applied perspective to our square. We will cover this in great detail in <code>Lesson 2</code> when we go 3D, so for now just know that Metal requires that we specify this attribute. Our second member, <code>textureCoordinate</code> doesn't require a special attribute. Our texture coordinates at each fragment in our square will be interpolated automatically by the rasterizer.</p> <p>Our new input into our <code>vertexShader()</code> function is of course our <code>vertexData</code>. This remains in the <code>constant</code> address space, which refers to buffers allocated in the read-only device memory pool. If you'd like to learn more about address spaces in Metal before I specifically cover them, please refer to section <code>4.0</code> of the Metal Shading Language Specification.</p> <p>As input to our <code>fragmentShader()</code> we'll pass in our <code>VertexOut</code> information, as we'll want the interpolated texture-coordinate information when sampling our texture. The <code>[[stage_in]]</code> attribute qualifier indicates that the <code>in</code> parameter is an input from the previous pipeline stage. Additionally, we'll also take in our texture as a <code>texture2d&lt;float&gt;</code>, specifying with the attribute <code>[[texture(0)]]</code> that we'll want the texture at index 0. Given that we only have one texture to sample from, we don't technically have to specify the texture slot, but it's a good practice to maintain. We first create a <code>sampler</code> object, specifying linear filtering for magnification and minification.</p> <ol> <li>Magnification: This occurs when a texture is displayed at a larger size on the screen than its original size (i.e., the texels cover more than one screen pixel). In this case, the shader needs to interpolate the color values between the texels to create a smooth transition between them and avoid a blocky appearance.</li> <li>Minification: This occurs when a texture is displayed at a smaller size on the screen than its original size (i.e., multiple texels are mapped to a single screen pixel). In this case, the shader needs to determine the best color value to represent the group of texels that are being combined into a single screen pixel.</li> </ol> <p>In the texture sampler, we specify linear for both mag_filter (magnification filter) and min_filter (minification filter), which means we want to use linear interpolation for both magnification and minification operations. Linear interpolation provides smoother and more natural transitions between the texels compared to nearest-neighbor filtering (which would result in a blocky or pixelated appearance). However, linear filtering may also introduce some blurriness, especially during minification.</p> <p>Finally, we sample and return the color from our texture, using our <code>textureSampler</code> and interpolated texture coordinate <code>in.textureCoordinate</code>.</p> <p>Before we'll be able to see our beautiful textured square, we'll have to make a couple of last changes in <code>mtl_engine.cpp</code>: mtl_engine.cpp<pre><code>void MTLEngine::encodeRenderCommand(MTL::RenderCommandEncoder* renderCommandEncoder) {\nrenderCommandEncoder-&gt;setRenderPipelineState(metalRenderPSO);\nrenderCommandEncoder-&gt;setVertexBuffer(squareVertexBuffer, 0, 0);\nMTL::PrimitiveType typeTriangle = MTL::PrimitiveTypeTriangle;\nNS::UInteger vertexStart = 0;\nNS::UInteger vertexCount = 6;\nrenderCommandEncoder-&gt;setFragmentTexture(grassTexture-&gt;texture, 0);\nrenderCommandEncoder-&gt;drawPrimitives(typeTriangle, vertexStart, vertexCount);\n}\n</code></pre> We'll set our <code>squareVertexBuffer</code>, update our vertex count to 6, and set our <code>grassTexture</code> at texture index 0 in our fragment shader. With this we can compile and run!</p> <p></p> <p>Yes yes, it does look like more of a rectangle than a square, but that's because our window is <code>800x600</code>. You can change it to <code>800x800</code> to make it square. We'll fix these scaling issues when we go 3D in Lesson 2.</p> <p>If you're stuck, you can download the source code for this chapter here.</p>"},{"location":"Lesson%202%3A%20Lets%20Go%203D%21/1.%203D%20Cube/","title":"Going 3D with Metal","text":"<p>Things will get a lot more interesting in this Chapter, as we're finally going 3D!</p> <p>To do this, we'll need to add 3 important things to our rendering engine:</p> <ol> <li>A 3D Object to Render.

And in particular, that's a lot of duplicated vertices. We're going to fix all of that unecessary duplication later in the chapter with something called Indexed Drawing.</p> <p>In addition, note the order in which I've specified vertices here. More experienced folks might recognize that the vertices have been specified to have a Clockwise (CW) Winding Order.\u3000Essentially, winding order is the order in which we specify the vertices of a triangle.

In our case, we will instruct Metal to use the Clockwise triangle winding order. The vertex winding order will determine which \"face\" or side of a given triangle corresponds to the front. Metal can then use this information to determine if a triangle face is facing towards or away from us, and cull it correspondingly. If a triangle is facing toward us we want to render it, as it will be unobstructed. If it's facing away from us, we can't see it, so we don't want to render it. Try to visualise the cube that we're going to be rendering. At any given time, we can only see at most 3 sides of it. That means that the remaining non-visible sides can be culled by Metal. Vertex winding order is important, as it allows us a cheap way to determine which triangles we don't need to render.</p> <p>Another question to ask is, how do you know which winding order to choose? This depends on the coordinate system you want to use for your rendering engine.
