title: 2. Hello Window
# Setting up our Window

Now that we've setup GLFW, it's time to make a window, as we'll need one before we're able to render anything to our screen. We're going to stash all of our rendering engine logic in a new file we'll call `mtl_engine.mm`, with the corresponding header `mtl_engine.hpp`. You might be wondering what the `.mm` extension is for. This is where the Objective-C I discussed in the `Setup` section comes in. Essentially, it tells Xcode to allow us to combine C++ and Objective-C code in the same file and compile it. We have to do this, because some of the windowing functions we'll need aren't mapped to the `metal-cpp` library for some reason, at least at the time of writing this. __Critically, we're going to want to change our `main.cpp` file to `main.mm` as well.__

In `mtl_engine.hpp`, we're first going to include the necessary headers for `GLFW` and `metal-cpp`:
````cpp
// mtl_engine.hpp
#pragma once

#define GLFW_INCLUDE_NONE
#import <GLFW/glfw3.h>
#define GLFW_EXPOSE_NATIVE_COCOA
#import <GLFW/glfw3native.h>

#include <Metal/Metal.hpp>
#include <Metal/Metal.h>
#include <QuartzCore/CAMetalLayer.hpp>
#include <QuartzCore/CAMetalLayer.h>
#include <QuartzCore/QuartzCore.hpp>
````
Notice the `#define GLFW_EXPOSE_NATIVE_COCOA` bit, which is a macro that exposes the native APIs of GLFW for the Cocoa framework on MacOS. It's critical to include that, as it's responsible for our windowing technique!

Next, we'll define our Metal Engine class, `MTLEngine`:
````cpp
// mtl_engine.hpp
class MTLEngine {
public:
    void init();
    void run();
    void cleanup();

private:
    void initDevice();
    void initWindow();
    
    MTL::Device* metalDevice;
    GLFWwindow* glfwWindow;
    NSWindow* metalWindow;
    CAMetalLayer* metalLayer;
};
````
We have three public functions that will be driven in our applications `main` function, `init()`, `run()`, and `cleanup()`. The `init()` function will do all of our Window and Metal setup. We're keeping it simple for now, just enough functionality to get a window opened. You'll notice 4 member variables defined at the bottom. The `MTL::Device* metalDevice` gives us access to our devices GPU, and the plethora of commands that it provides us for rendering and GPU compute work. `GLFWwindow* glfwWindow` gives us a handle to our GLFWwindow, was well as GLFW's various callback functions, like handling keyboard input and whatnot. Don't worry, we'll dig into it more later. We also have our `NSWindow* metalWindow` and `CAMetalLayer* metalLayer`, which are actually our first two Objective-C variables. I'll explain their purpose when we create the window.

First, let's take a look at the Engine implementation:
````cpp linenums="1"
//  mtl_engine.mm
#include "mtl_engine.hpp"

void MTLEngine::init() {
    initDevice();
    initWindow();
}

void MTLEngine::run() {
    while (!glfwWindowShouldClose(glfwWindow)) {
        glfwPollEvents();
    }
}

void MTLEngine::cleanup() {
    glfwTerminate();
}

void MTLEngine::initDevice() {
    metalDevice = MTL::CreateSystemDefaultDevice();
}

void MTLEngine::initWindow() {
    glfwInit();
    glfwWindowHint(GLFW_CLIENT_API, GLFW_NO_API);
    glfwWindow = glfwCreateWindow(800, 600, "Metal Engine", NULL, NULL);
    if (!glfwWindow) {
        glfwTerminate();
        exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
    }
    
    metalWindow = glfwGetCocoaWindow(glfwWindow);
    metalLayer = [CAMetalLayer layer];
    metalLayer.device = (__bridge id<MTLDevice>)metalDevice;
    metalLayer.pixelFormat = MTLPixelFormatBGRA8Unorm;
    metalWindow.contentView.layer = metalLayer;
    metalWindow.contentView.wantsLayer = YES;
}
````
It's only 38 lines, so it shouldn't be terribly confusing.

````cpp
void MTLEngine::init() {
    initDevice();
    initWindow();
}
````
In the `init()` function, all we're going to be doing is calling Metal and Window setup, so we call our only two setup functions `initDevice()` and `initWindow()`. 


````cpp
void MTLEngine::initDevice() {
    metalDevice = MTL::CreateSystemDefaultDevice();
}
````
The `initDevice()` function should feel familiar, we're simply using the `metal-cpp` library to create our Metal Device (which we used in the Setup) with which we will access all of our Metal rendering functions. 

````cpp
void MTLEngine::initWindow() {
    glfwInit();
    glfwWindowHint(GLFW_CLIENT_API, GLFW_NO_API);
    glfwWindow = glfwCreateWindow(800, 600, "Metal Engine", NULL, NULL);
    if (!glfwWindow) {
        glfwTerminate();
        exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
    }

    metalWindow = glfwGetCocoaWindow(glfwWindow);
    metalLayer = [CAMetalLayer layer];
    metalLayer.device = (__bridge id<MTLDevice>)metalDevice;
    metalLayer.pixelFormat = MTLPixelFormatBGRA8Unorm;
    metalWindow.contentView.layer = metalLayer;
    metalWindow.contentView.wantsLayer = YES;
}
````
The `initWindow()` function first initializes GLFW, and uses `glfwWindowHint()` to tell GLFW not to create the OpenGL graphics context, as we're using Metal instead :). We set our `glfwWindow`, with a window width of `800` and height of `600`, and a window name of `Metal Engine`. If window creation fails, we exit.

We then set our `metalWindow` with a call to `glfwGetCocoaWindow()`, specifying our `glfwWindow` as the input. This gives us a reference to the underlying native macOS Cocoa window that `GLFW` uses underneath for window management. We then use some funky Objective-C syntax `[CAMetalLayer layer]` to create a metalLayer, as the `metal-cpp` library does not yet expose all of the parts necessary to do this for some reason. We then set a device, using the `__bridge id<MTLDevice>` cast to convert from a C++ `MTL::Device*` pointer to an Objective-C `MTLDevice*`. We'll eventually end up using this bridging interface a little bit more to convert back and forth between Objective-C and C++ types. We then set the `pixelFormat` for the `metalLayer`, and give the `metalLayer` to the Cocoa window. 

By setting the layer of the `contentView` to our `metalLayer`, we're telling the Cocoa window underneath to use the Metal layer for rendering its content. The Metal layer will provide the low-level access to Metal that we need to perform our graphics rendering. Once the layer of the `contentView` is set, any content that we draw on the Metal layer will be displayed in the window. Essentially, the Metal layer is acting as what's called the "framebuffer". We also specify the `wantsLayer` property of the window's `contentView`, to ensure that the Cocoa window underneath will use the `metalLayer` for rendering its content.

````cpp
void MTLEngine::run() {
    while (!glfwWindowShouldClose(glfwWindow)) {
        glfwPollEvents();
    }
}
````
Next, we have the `run()` function, which will eventually be our main program loop, where we'll handle our window updates and draw to the screen. The loop continues until `glfwWindowShouldClose(glfwWindow)` returns true, which for now will only happen when you hit the red close button at the top of the window. Every iteration of the loop, we'll need to call `glfwPollEvents()`, which we'll eventually use for handling keyboard input. If you don't include it now, the window won't launch!

````cpp
void MTLEngine::cleanup() {
    glfwTerminate();
}
````
Our last function is the `cleanup()` function, where we'll eventually be handling our de-initiallisation and de-allocation of resources upon program close. For now, this will just include one command, `glfwTerminate()`.

In order to instantiate our `MTLEngine`, head in to `main.mm` include the `mtl_engine.hpp` header, and create the engine:
````cpp
//  main.mm
#include "mtl_engine.hpp"

int main() {
    
    MTLEngine engine;
    engine.init();
    engine.run();
    engine.cleanup();
    
    return 0;
}
````

If you build an run, you should get a beautiful blank looking window:
